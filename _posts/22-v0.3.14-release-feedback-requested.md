In April, I [started working on v0.3 of Ocuroot](/blog/ocuroot-sdk-v0-3-canaries/) after realizing that my first attempt at an SDK just wasn't cutting it. Since then, it's been non-stop evolution, towards a more complete, open source CI/CD tool that can
handle complex dependencies and create or tear down complete environments easily. Plus a Python-like configuration language so you don't have to wrestle with YAML when all you need is an if statement.

Fast forward five months and [Ocuroot v0.3.14](https://github.com/ocuroot/ocuroot/releases/tag/v0.3.14) is available and ready for you to get hands-on. So I'm asking you for your help in putting it through its paces. If you want to dive in right away, there's a [quickstart repo](https://github.com/ocuroot/quickstart) to serve as something of a self-guided demo.

# What's available

* [Starlark](https://bazel.build/rules/language) based config that can run in CI or locally (there's even a REPL!).
* [State and intent](/docs/usage/state/) storage in Git for GitOps-like workflows.
* [Dependency management](/docs/usage/dependencies/) to ensure resources are deployed in the correct order and automatically redeploy when needed.
* Custom state for managing approvals and manual configuration.
* Create and populate new environments automatically, and tear them down when no longer needed.
* [Dry run](https://www.ocuroot.com/docs/reference/cli/work/) mode to double-check what will happen before execution.
* Local web UI for browsing state.

# What's still to come

Being pre-1.0, it's probably clear that there's still a lot of work to be done. And what project is every truly finished?
The current road map includes improvements such as:

* [CI integration](/docs/usage/ci-integration/) is doable, but not as easy as it should be.
* Rollback via intent is possible, but an automated process is on the roadmap ([#12](https://github.com/ocuroot/ocuroot/issues/12)).
* Init commands to make setting up a repo even easier. ([#10](https://github.com/ocuroot/ocuroot/issues/10))

# How you can help

I'm looking for any and all feedback on the current state of Ocuroot. Please work through the quickstart, take a look over
the docs and for the adventurous, maybe try Ocuroot on a side project!

I want to make this the best tool it can be, so want to hear about any rough edges, confusing terminology or use cases
you'd like to explore. Everything's open source, so you can leave your thoughts as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ocuroot/ocuroot/issues).

And if you're feeling generous, GitHub stars are always appreciated! [https://github.com/ocuroot/ocuroot](https://github.com/ocuroot/ocuroot)
