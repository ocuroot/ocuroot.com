It's Monday! Time for a short progress update.

There’s now a preview set of documentation for Ocuroot live at: [https://docs.ocuroot.com](https://docs.ocuroot.com).

There are pages to introduce you to the core concepts of Ocuroot, a quickstart guide and detailed reference guides for the CLI tool and the SDK.

I’d love to hear your thoughts! I want to make the onboarding experience for Ocuroot as seamless as possible and the documentation is going to play a huge part in this.

Feel free to send feedback to contact@ocuroot.com.
