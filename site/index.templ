			<p>
				Your team think about deployments in terms of the destination: dev, staging, production.
				But many CI solutions don't go beyond the pipeline, making adding an environment an all-hands-on-deck slog.
			</p>
			<p>
				Got a big customer demanding a dedicated environment for their data? Need an EU region for GDPR?
				Want to spin up a load-testing environment? Good luck!
			</p>
			<p>
				Ocuroot treats environments as a first-class concept, so adding or removing an environment can be as simple as
				editing a single file.
			</p>

		@section.ContentSectionWithImage("Escape YAML hell and long cycle times", "/images/code.png", "No YAML, just imperative code", "left") {
			<p>
				Centralized, YAML-based CI solutions two big problems. You need to learn their particular YAML DSL to even do
				simple branching logic. And you have to push to the remote to test every, single, change.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ocuroot configuration is defined with Python-like Starlark syntax. So if you need an if statement or a for loop, you can just write one.
				Plus you can run your logic locally for super-tight feedback loops.
			</p>

			<p>
				Follow the state of your infrastructure and applications in Ocuroot, and quickly shut down anything that's no longer needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a complete view of your production resources, you can identify unused or underutilized instances, old test environments, and orphaned services that are costing you money without providing value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ocuroot makes it easy to track resource usage across all your environments, helping you maintain a lean and cost-effective infrastructure.
